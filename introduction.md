## Storytelling as human condition

When we use the a narrative structure to communicate concepts we connect with our audience not only on a presentation level but also on intimate an personal level, because the audience can bond with the caracthers, the objects or the environments of the story.

## What is storytelling?

> "Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment.
Every culture has its own stories or narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values."

## What is the use of storytelling?

Storytelling can be used as a tool for different purposes; however, it goes beyond a simple planned activity to become part of our individual and collective life experience. The uses of storytelling are in fact limitless.

## Interactive storytelling in Literature
One of the first example of interactive storytelling in literature can be found in the series ["Choose your own adventure"](https://www.cyoa.com/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from Edward Packard. Here the reader can choose how to follow the narrative in a non-liner fashion and choosing the path of a multiple ending story. Those types of stories can be categorized also as [gamebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

> Choose Your Own Adventure books were a series of kids gamebooks popular in the 1980s. They were written from a second-person point of view where the reader became the protagonist, making choices that would alter the story. The books would sell over 350 million copies through the 80s.

## Narrative vs Storytelling
"Narrative" and "Storytelling" are not two interchangable terms. While the term "narrative" usually relate to the part of the story that deal with its style and structure, the term "storytelling" involves not only the act of telling the story but also the relationship with the audience, the enviroment, the content and much more...

> "The term "storytelling" can refer specifically to oral storytelling but also broadly to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story."
>
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

> "...the recent decades of this century have seen a tremendous development of diverse theories of narrative, so many and so diverse that it makes the mind ache to think of them all."

In 2018, the Association for Research in Digital Interactive Narratives (ARDIN) was formed.
