>"Black Mirror Bandersnatch is a very interesting concept. It gives you choices that start out simple like choosing a cereal box for breakfast and steadily moves towards darker decisions. You find yourself choosing who lives and dies and what to destroy and what to save. If we take a look at todays society, most people have become desensitized to so many different things. You are either numb to the world or sheltered from it. And this is the real point I think Bandersnatch is getting at. I found myself choosing bad decisions because I wanted to see how it would turn out. And I'm sure many other people did the same". *Comment by Nicolas A. on Twitter*

## More examples of Non-Linear narratives (Interactive)

### Multiple-ending stories
Usually, they have a well-defined beginning but can branch in different directions with the choice of different ending.

> "Some games in the Final Fantasy series have multiple or secret endings, the ending depending on the player's actions taken during the game. These can be as simple as minor adjustments to the final story scenes to reflect variable outcomes earlier in the game, or as drastic as entirely different conclusions to the story"
[https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Multiple_endings](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Multiple_endings)

### Branch stories

![Branch stories graph](fig/Fig_22_self_produced_graph.png){alt='graph'}


These types of stories branch in different directions but usually the have one ending, the user can make decision along the narrative.

The entire Dragon Age series offers you multiple occasions where they have to make a decision; these choices can be small and change next to nothing, or they can be large plot points that go on to echo in the rest of the sequels.

### Open ended stories

![Open ended stories graph](fig/FIg_24_assas.png){alt='graph'}


Can be all the above combined without a specific or well-defined ending. Sometime used in films for sequels.

### Player driven stories (Open worlds)
> "People sometimes think "open-world" means an absence of narrative, just complete freedom of choice. But that’s not necessarily the case. In fact, it rarely is."

Examples:

- Avalon RPG Game
- Online Since 1984

## Storytelling in Heritage Interpretation

>"...interpreters are charged with transforming a seemingly unmanageable amount of information into something suitable for the public."
[https://ncph.org/history-at-work/reinterpreting-freeman-tilden/](https://ncph.org/history-at-work/reinterpreting-freeman-tilden/)

The 6 Freeman Tilden principles from the book «Interpreting Our Heritage».

1. Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile. (who’s the audience?)
2. Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information. (where’s the science?)
3. Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
4. The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation. (what’s the story?)
5. Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase. (what’s the story?)
6. Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program. (who’s the audience?)
